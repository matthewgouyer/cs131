//Task 1:
Give commands and Output of :
1. The number of lines in last.fake before filtering
2. The command you used to make the file such that only lines that have "sp24" are in the "lastsp24.fake" file. (Similar to how you extracted US data from YoutubeDataset)
3. The number of lines in lastsp24.fake after you filtered everything that does not have "sp24"

   12  grep 'sp24' last.fake > lastsp24.fake
   14  wc -l last.fake
   15  wc -l lastsp24.fake

//Task 2:
Find all the usernames that logged in on a Sunday from the lastsp24.fake file.
Give only the distinct users.

   16  grep 'Sun' lastsp24.fake | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq

//Task 3:
Find all the night owls from the lastsp24.fake file.
Use the apporpriate file to find the users who logged in between 11PM - 4 AM ( inclusing 11PM, use >= 11PM and <=4AM)
Again, give a list of distinct users.

   17  awk '$8 >= "23:00" || $8 <= "04:00" {print $1}' lastsp24.fake | sort | uniq

//Task 4:
Find all the Early Birds from the lastsp24.fake file.
Use the appropriate file to find the users who logged in between 5AM to 9AM ( including 9AM, use >=5AM and <= 9AM)

   18  awk '$8 >= "05:00" && $8 <= "09:00" {print $1}' lastsp24.fake | sort | uniq

//Task 5:
Display the users having a username that starts with "t"
Directions : use awk and regex that we used in Class activity to find Tomatoes!

   19  awk '{print $1}' lastsp24.fake | grep '^t' | sort | uniq

//Task 6:
Use awk on the passwd.fake file to find all users that have usernames starting with 'a' and have UID divisble by 2.
(Notice that you have to use && as I only want the list of users who qualify both conditions)

   20  awk -F: '$1 ~ /^a/ && $3 % 2 == 0 {print $1}' passwd.fake | sort | uniq

//Task 7:
Use sed on passwd.fake to Display all the distinct lines left in passwd.fake after deleting all letter and digits and spaces.

   21  sed 's/[a-zA-Z0-9 ]//g' passwd.fake | sort -u
