//1. This commando is search for all files in the /etc dir and one.txt is
// redirecting the standard output to a txt file
//2. and 2> two.txt is redirecting the standard error to a txt file
[matthewsp24@sjsu cs131]$ find /etc -type f > one.txt 2> two.txt

//3. to view the contents of one.txt & two.txt we use cat. they show standard
// output and error libraries
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ cat one.txt
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ cat two.txt

//4. we used this command to extract the dates from the dataset
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ cut -d ',' -f 20,21 Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv > dates.txt

//5. then used sort to group the same dates together
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ sort dates.txt > sorted_dates.txt

//6. then used unq with 0c to count the # of occurnces for each date
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ uniq -c sorted_dates.txt > date_counts.txt

//7. then used sort again but with -n to sort the dates by the number of occurences
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ sort -n -r date_counts.txt > sorted_date_counts.txt
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ head -3 sorted_date_counts.txt
     15 2006,Mar
     13 2014,Jul
     12 2014,Aug

//8. then to get the top 3 most number of youtube channels created date
// we use head -3
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$  head -3 sorted_date_counts.txt

//9. to find all processes owned by us we us this command to list
// all those processes
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ ps -u $USER

//10.  when we use a command like vi file.txt in one terminal and then check
// the processes in another terminal, we should see the vi process listed.
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ vi file.txt

//11. We can find the process id ofr the init process with this command
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$ ps -p 1

//12. we use this command to display info about all running processes.
//The ‘a’ option tells ps to list the processes of all users on the system
// rather than just those of the current user,
// ‘u’ provides detailed information, and ‘x’ also
// lists processes that do not have a controlling
// terminal, such as daemons.
[matthewsp24@sjsu Assignment2]$  ps aux
